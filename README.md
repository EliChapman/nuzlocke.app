# Nuzlock tracker

This project is designed for tracking Nuzlocke runs, the Pokemon
you've encountered and their status. But it also provides information
and adivce for Bosses you face. 

### Contributing

Currently, I'm working through entering the data for all existing
games but this can easily be made to support mods or other game
formats.

If you want to contribute you will need to provide 2 files, the
`routes.txt` and `league.txt` which should be in the following format
below

**League data**
```
--1|Gym Leader Name|Gym Leader Speciality|/image/path
pokemon|level|move1,move2,move3,move4|ability|held-item
pokemon|level|move1,move2,move3,move4|ability|held-item
pokemon|level|move1,move2,move3,move4|ability|held-item
```

**Route data**
```
Route 1
Route 2
--Gym battle|1|gym-leader
Route 3
```

### Alternatives

There are a lot of alternatives out there, and whilst they don't meet
the needs I personally was looking for, you should absolutely check
them out and thank their creators.
